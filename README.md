## Introducing Fun2Code

How many times have we encountered a situation when we are unable to find a teammate for a hackathon from our college?

A lot!

To solve this problem, I created a platform for my fellow college students to find the type of person they want for their hackathon. Like if someone needs an app developer for their project, they can go on the platform, select from the filters available, and they are good to go üëç.

Connecting is a part of growing as an individualüë§!

So try this now:
